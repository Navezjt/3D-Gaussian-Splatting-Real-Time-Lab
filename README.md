3D Gaussian Splatting Real-Time Lab

I wanted to be able to shot a video and turn that into a 3D Gaussian splatting model for viewing locally on my windows gaming PC.
This is an experimental workflow result from my lab around that.

The base project in this colab is based on:
https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/

These are scaled down gif shorts, but both are rendered using the same Gaussian Splatting model.<br>Bottom just has the "splattes" scaled down for better view of the point clusters generated.<br>
